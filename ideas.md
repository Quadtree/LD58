# Station 9
The Station 7 creature has arrived at Station 9. This is a first-person VR-optional puzzle game.

The station has 3 accessible rooms:

## Room 1
The door from the pod slides open revealing Room 1.

The two main things to do here are:
- Assemble the laser pistol. Easy. There are 3 parts of the pistol in cabinets. All simply have to be pushed together.
- Talk to the AI. There's an AI here that will give hints. It will be important later, too. It consists of a screen on the wall with a dialog tree on it. The AI will also explain that to get off the ship, you must collect the 3 pieces of the Alien Artifact. One is in a cabinet here.

Once the laser is assembled, it can be used to burn through the lock on the door. The laser can destroy brown things.

## Room 2
This room has a piece of the alien artifact hanging from a rope above a metal plate. The trick is that you need to burn the rope, but you can't hit it directly. Instead, you need to bounce the laser off mirrors. So you can see what you're doing, there is a camera showing the upper level.

The door to Room 3 is wide open.

## Room 3
This is the storage control room. From here, you can control the Retreival Robot. What you need to do is:
- Put your laser pistol on the robot.
- Drive the robot into the back room
- Destroy the lock on the storage cabinet with the laser.
- The cabinet will burst open and the artifact will fall out. If it _doesn't_ land on the robot, a tractor beam will pull it back in and it will fall back out. Eventually the user should realize they need to catch it on the

Opening the door to Room 4 requires the AI to run the door. You'll need to go talk to it. It will ask you a silly riddle.

# Room 4
The portal room. The portal simply needs the collected 3 objects. The portal probably leads to Station 10.
